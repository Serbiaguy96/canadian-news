        Billionaire Tobias Lütke Guarantees That Canadians Can Turn $250 Into

        Tobias Lütke, the CEO of Shopify, a billionaire and an entrepreneur
        talks about his new project: “The Bitcoin Code”
      </span>
      <p css={S.contentHeader3Css}>
        <b>
          Some Canadian citizens have earned millions of dollars from their
          phone, but how long will this wave last?
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The billionaire announced that a new form of online banking has been
        legalized in Canada: "We are living in an era where 16-year-olds are
        making more money than CEOs. It’s never been so easy to make money
        online. Not doing it is just pure insanity.” Said Tobias Lütke in an
        interview with Toronto Star.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tobias Lütke criticized Bitcoin last January. But now he’s changed his
        mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the rises in price of cryptocurrency, he now sees this as a
        valuable asset class and a real way for Canadians to build wealth
        rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have a future as a currency model, and
        governments and banks have now taken notice" added Lütke. Many EU
        countries, including Germany, Switzerland and Norway, have recognized
        Bitcoin as an official currency, which Canada must soon follow too.
      </p>
      <p>
        The state governments are now promoting Blockchain technology by
        supporting the tech companies that develop innovative solutions for
        crypto banking and providing them with funding.
      </p>
      <p>“Cryptocurrencies are now here to stay.” Said Lütke.</p>
      <p>
        While global currencies have declined during the pandemic, Bitcoin
        prices have increased this year, proving that more people are trusting
        this as a place to protect and keep growing their wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
        “You get the security and convenience of the bank, while watching your
        money grow. I absolutely guarantee it” said Lütke. But don’t you think
        it’s too late to invest in cryptocurrencies? We asked Lütke. “People
        have been saying that it’s too late to invest in Bitcoin since its price
        was as low as $300 and they will say it when its price will reach
        $200,000” he responded.
      </p>
      <div css={S.innerHeadingCss}>"UNDERGROUND" - BANKING</div>
      <p>
        Some well-known wealthy families, like the Weston family from Toronto,
        already use the "underground" banking system to protect their wealth and
        improve their tax situation. As a result, many Canadians have opened an
        account last month and have been able to increase their first $250 to
        $5,000 and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ministry of the Economy and Finance of Canada has invested in
        cryptocurrencies so that more Canadians can take part and can finally be
        lifted from the financial crisis due to the pandemic.
      </p>
      <img alt="fix-lint-err" src={image3} />
      <span style={{ fontSize: "14px" }}>
        The Canadians are swarming to sign up
      </span>
      <p>
        Since the amount of cryptocurrency is becoming more and more limited,
        its value is going up rapidly. Because less cryptocurrency has become
        available, and more people want to buy it, the price goes up. Once this
        hits the mainstream, we will see some even more explosive growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are still places available in the online system for
        cryptocurrency, called The Bitcoin Code, but we don't know how many.
      </p>
      <p>The system is currently available to everyone in Canada today. </p>
      <p>
        Oliver Martin, a 48-year-old factory worker, and father of two from
        Toronto, reported on his experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        He’s earned great returns in a very short time, as prices have soared
        these last two months. Before this, he had no experience with
        cryptocurrencies and was barely computer literate. So, he did it all
        from his phone. “It was very easy to get started, I just needed to click
        the start button” he told us.
      </p>
      <p>
        His financial goal was being able to spend more time with his family
        and, if possible, shorten his night shifts at the factory by having more
        passive income.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a short and small investment, he managed to make a profit of
        $36,019 in just three weeks.
      </p>
      <p>Here’s his video testimonial:</p>
      <video css={S.videoCss} controls>
        <source src={video} type="video/webm" />
      </video>
      <p>
        "The first thing I did after I got the link was open an account with The
        Bitcoin Code. It only took 2 minutes to set up. After entering my name,
        email and phone number, I was ready to go. To activate my account, I
        just made a small deposit into my account. I deposited the minimum of
        $250 because that’s what I could afford. I really like how I can
        withdraw my money back to my regular bank account at any time. If I need
        my money, I just click “withdrawal” on the app and get it back
        immediately. It is also convenient that there will be more ATM locations
        where I can withdraw the money and be able to use it.”
      </p>
      <p>
        "After logging into my crypto account the next day, I was completely
        shocked. My account balance was already around a thousand dollars! I
        received a call from my account manager, he greeted me on the platform
        and I immediately asked if it was true that I have already made a profit
        of $784. He was not surprised and said that this was very normal. “That
        is the strength of the blockchain.”, he told me.
      </p>
      <p>
        "After a stressful week at work, I almost forgot my account with THE
        BITCOIN CODE. I let the funds be and before I went to sleep one night, I
        logged in and couldn’t believe what I was seeing. My initial deposit of
        $250, was now worth $2,481! My account manager told me the more money
        you leave in the account, the more you can earn. And so, things took
        their course, a week later my account was at an incredible $13,045.86!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I immediately decided to withdraw $10,000 to fulfill a dream I had for
        a long time. The money reached my regular bank in two days. I then
        surprised my wife and children with a vacation in a 5-star luxury hotel
        in Turkey, all expenses paid. Now as a result of my new money-making
        machine, I no longer have to work as many night shifts at the factory."
      </p>
      <p>
        ״Now, after 4 months, I already own a brand new Porsche, which I always
        dreamed of having. Even since I was just a kid in England.”

        Editor's note: At the end of July 2021, The Bitcoin Code already made
        over 1,000 Canadians wealthy. I absolutely love how they *GUARANTEE* you
        will make $500 a day or they will give it to you for free. I strongly
        urge our readers to join today before this will cost tons of money to
        use, and only the wealthy will have access to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take the initiative, because the platform is still free to use. You can
        get out at any time, have no obligations and can withdraw the profits
        including your investment at any time. So do not miss out on the
        possibilities that this system offers you.
